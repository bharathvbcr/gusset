# DevCouncil Verification & Next Actions

DevCouncil's verifier is **deterministic** (no extra LLM calls for stub/effort detection).
It decides pass/fail from evidence: diffs, test output, coverage intersection, and policy checks.

This skill does not make verification mandatory. Check `gates.mode` first:

- `enforce`: verification and effective blocking gaps govern task release.
- `advisory`: verification is optional; quality findings are recorded as advisory.
- `off`: quality verification is skipped. Report work as completed unverified.

Hard-safety findings remain blocking in every mode.

## Verification outputs

`devcouncil_verify_task` (or `dev verify`, `dev check --verify`) returns:

- **`passed`** — no blocking gaps remain
- **`blocking_gaps`** — must fix before release only in `enforce` (hard safety
  remains blocking in every mode)
- **`next_actions`** — typed, machine-routable repair instructions

Read persisted state without re-verifying:

```
devcouncil_get_gaps           # gap list (blocking_only filter available)
devcouncil_get_diff           # working-tree diff, optionally scoped to the task
```

Those two are the whole persisted-state surface this host serves.
`devcouncil_get_next_actions`, `devcouncil_get_evidence` and
`devcouncil_get_task_provenance` belonged to the retired Python host. The typed
actions and `allowed_next_tools` ride on the `devcouncil_verify_task` result;
evidence and the audit trail come from `dev verify TASK-ID --json` and the
persisted state under `.devcouncil/`.

## Next-actions contract

Each action includes:

| Field | Use |
|---|---|
| `gap_id` | Stable identifier for tracking |
| `gap_type` | e.g. `diff_not_exercised`, `stub_detected`, `orphan_diff` |
| `category` | Branch on this: `fix_code`, `add_test`, `fix_verification`, `scope`, `security`, `review`, `plan` |
| `severity` | `high` / `medium` / `low` |
| `blocking` | Must fix when true |
| `action` | Human-readable fix instruction |
| `file` / `line` | Precise location |
| `suggested_command` | Command to run after fixing |

Act on **blocking** actions first. Advisory actions surface quality issues but do not
block release unless configured to.

## Diff↔coverage gate

A passing test suite only counts if it **executed the changed lines**. The verifier
intersects coverage data with diff hunks. An unexercised diff yields `diff_not_exercised`.

- **Signal-first by default** — informational unless `verification.diff_coverage.enforce: true`
- **Hard tasks** — `verification.rigor.enforce_coverage_on_hard` promotes to blocking
- **Degrades silently** when coverage tooling or parseable diff is unavailable — never
  blocks correct work for lack of measurement

Config (`.devcouncil/config.yaml`):

```yaml
verification:
  diff_coverage:
    measure: true
    enforce: false
    min_ratio: 0.0
```

## Anti-laziness rigor

Scales strictness by task **difficulty** (`easy` / `normal` / `hard`):

| Gate | Easy/Normal | Hard |
|---|---|---|
| Stub/TODO detection | Advisory | Blocking |
| Effort heuristics (undersized diff) | Advisory | Blocking |
| Coarse acceptance proof | Advisory | Blocking |
| Diff coverage | Advisory (unless enforce) | Blocking (default) |

Stub markers (`TODO`, `NotImplementedError`, assert-free tests) block on hard tasks unless
the task mentions scaffolding and the line carries `devcouncil: allow-stub`.

Repair runs include a **correction manifest** with prior diff, failing output, and
non-negotiable rules: never weaken tests, never stub around a gap.

## Repair workflow (`enforce`, or when explicitly requested)

1. Read `next_actions` from the `devcouncil_verify_task` result, or
   `devcouncil_get_gaps` for the persisted list — list blocking items
2. Fix each gap (smallest change that closes it)
3. Re-run the suggested tests with your host's own command tool
4. `devcouncil_verify_task` — repeat until `passed`
5. `/devcouncil:repair [TASK-ID]` or `dev repair [TASK-ID]` for CLI-guided repair

## CLI equivalents

```bash
dev verify [TASK-ID]          # full task verification
dev gaps [TASK-ID]            # list gaps
dev check --verify --test "…" # inline requirement on current diff
dev report                    # Requirement→Task→Diff→Evidence coverage
dev report rigor              # tune rigor thresholds from evidence
```

## When to call success

- In `enforce`, only claim verified success when `passed: true` with zero
  effective blocking gaps.
- In `advisory`, distinguish test results from optional DevCouncil verification
  and report advisory findings honestly.
- In `off`, completion does not require a task or verifier call; say
  **completed unverified** and include any tests you chose to run.
