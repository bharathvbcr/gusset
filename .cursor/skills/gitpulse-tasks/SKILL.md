description: File, import, list, read, complete, merge and delete tasks on the GitPulse task board over MCP — the board a person sees in GitPulse and launches agents from. Use when an agent needs to record follow-up work, plan upcoming tasks, put Markdown task briefs from a repository's tasks/ folder onto the board, read a task's brief before implementing it, mark the task it was launched on done when the work is finished, merge duplicate tasks into one, or delete a task that should not exist, with a recorded reason.

# GitPulse tasks

Tasks live on the **GitPulse task board** — the Tasks view a person opens in
GitPulse, where each card can be handed to an agent. The `gitpulse-mcp` server
writes to and reads from that board directly. A task you file appears there
within a couple of seconds while GitPulse's window is on screen, and as soon as the
window is shown otherwise.

| Tool | Kind | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gitpulse_add_task` | write | File one task on the board for a repository. |
| `gitpulse_import_tasks` | write | Put every Markdown brief in the repository's `tasks/` folder onto the board. |
| `gitpulse_list_tasks` | read | List the board's tasks for a repository, in board order; `archived: true` lists the archive instead. |
| `gitpulse_get_task` | read | Read one task with its canonical agent brief. |
| `gitpulse_complete_task` | write | Move your task to `done` when the work is finished (or `review`, or `in_progress`), with a summary. |
| `gitpulse_delete_task` | write, destructive | Delete a task card that should not exist, with a reason. |
| `gitpulse_merge_tasks` | write, destructive | Fold duplicate or overlapping tasks into one that stays, and delete the rest, with a reason. |

Every write requires the repository to be **trusted** in GitPulse. An untrusted
repository is refused with `untrusted_repository`; ask the person to open it in
GitPulse and trust it. No write can start an agent run, and only
`gitpulse_delete_task` and `gitpulse_merge_tasks` remove a card.

## Before you file a task

A person reads every card on the board. Thirty narrow cards from one review are
thirty things to triage; five that each own a concern are a plan. File the
fewest tasks that cover the work.

1. Call `gitpulse_list_tasks` with the absolute `repo_path` and read what is
   already open. `repository: null` means no task has ever been filed under
   this repository — not that its tasks are all done. It lists the board:
   Done tasks stay on it until a person archives them, and archived tasks are
   listed only with `archived: true`. Each task carries `archived` and
   `completed_at`.
2. **Group before you file.** When you have several findings, sort them by the
   concern they share — the same subsystem, the same root cause, the same fix —
   and file one task per concern, each finding an acceptance criterion. One
   task per finding is the wrong shape.
3. **Fold into an open task** when your work belongs to one: read it with
   `gitpulse_get_task`, then call `gitpulse_add_task` with its `item_id` as
   `task_id` and `overwrite: true`. Every field you send replaces the card's,
   so send its existing title, description and criteria **plus** yours. Every
   field you leave out — status, priority, severity, owner, due date, labels,
   logs — stays exactly as the card had it, as do its column position and links.
4. **Merge duplicates you find.** When the board already holds two or more
   open tasks for one concern, fold them into one with
   `gitpulse_merge_tasks` (see [Merging tasks](#merging-tasks)) rather than
   filing another or deleting all but one.
5. File a new task only for work no open task covers.

`gitpulse_add_task` holds you to this. A new task that looks like open work —
two shared title words, or one shared title word and a shared label that is not
just that word again — is refused with `related_tasks_exist`, and nothing is
filed. The refusal lists the related open tasks (`item_id`, status, title, and
what they share). Read them, then either fold your work into one (step 3), or,
when it is genuinely separate work, call again with `reviewed_related` naming
**every** listed `item_id`. Naming some of them is refused again. A finished
(`done`) task never counts, nor does an archived one in any column — archiving
is its own flag, separate from Done — and an overwrite is never checked. The success
answer carries `related_check`: how many related open tasks there were, how many
open tasks were compared, and whether that was all of them (`scan_complete`).

## Filing a task

```json
{
  "repo_path": "/absolute/path/to/repo",
  "task_id": "gp-oauth-auth",
  "title": "Implement OAuth2 and passkey authentication",
  "description": "Add PKCE authorization code flow and passkey credentials support.",
  "status": "ready",
  "priority": 1,
  "severity": "high",
  "kind": "feature",
  "owner": "@alice",
  "due": "2026-05-01",
  "labels": ["auth", "security"],
  "planned_files": ["src/auth.rs", "src/tokens.rs"],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Support PKCE code exchange flow",
    "Passkey registration and login endpoints verify signatures"
  ]
}
```

`task_id` is the task's stable key. Filing the same `task_id` again is refused
with `already_exists`, so a retried call never makes a duplicate card. Pass
`overwrite: true` to replace the task's content — under the `task_id` it was
filed with, or under a board `item_id`, which is how you extend a task the
person made on the board. Its column position and links on the board are kept.
A task the person deleted on the board stays deleted (`deleted_on_board`);
choose another `task_id`. A title or description the person **locked** on
the card is theirs: an overwrite that would change it is refused with
`field_locked`, and one that leaves it as it is goes through.

| Parameter | Required | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `repo_path` | yes | Absolute path to the repository (any of its worktrees). |
| `title` | yes | One line, at most 300 characters. |
| `task_id` | no | Letters, digits, `-`, `_`, `.`; at most 96 bytes. Defaults to `gp-` plus the title's slug. |
| `description` | no | Markdown, at most 65,536 bytes including folded sections. |
| `status` | no | `inbox` (default), `backlog`, `ready`, `in_progress`, `review`, `done`. |
| `priority` | no | `0` urgent, `1` high, `2` normal (default), `3` low. |
| `severity` | no | `none` (default), `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`. |
| `kind` | no | Free text, at most 64 bytes; default `feature`. |
| `owner` | no | At most 300 bytes. |
| `due` | no | `YYYY-MM-DD`, or Unix seconds. |
| `labels` | no | At most 64, each at most 128 bytes. |
| `acceptance_criteria` | no | At most 128, each at most 4,096 bytes. |
| `planned_files` | no | At most 256. The board has no planned-files field, so they are kept as a `## Planned files` section of the description. |
| `repositories` | no | Other related repository names, kept as a `## Related repositories` section. |
| `logs` | no | Raw evidence kept verbatim, at most 256 KiB. |
| `overwrite` | no | Replace an existing task's content, by `task_id` or board `item_id`. |
| `reviewed_related` | no | At most 25 `item_id`s: every task a `related_tasks_exist` refusal listed, once you have read them and judged this separate. |

## Importing briefs from `tasks/`

`gitpulse_import_tasks` reads every `*.md` file in `tasks/` (or `tasks_dir`)
and puts each brief on the board under its key: the brief's `id`, else its file
name. It is safe to run again. Briefs already on the board are left alone unless
you pass `replace: true`.

Import is the person's bulk path and is **not** checked for related open tasks.
If you are the one writing the briefs, group them first, exactly as in
[Before you file a task](#before-you-file-a-task): one brief per concern.

Every file is accounted for. Each entry in `entries` has an `outcome`:
`created`, `updated`, `unchanged`, `already_present`, `deleted_on_board`,
`invalid` (with the reason, e.g. an unknown status), or `failed`. `ok` is true
only when every file was placed. Read `invalid` before you report success.
Symbolic links, non-UTF-8 files, files over 1 MiB, and two files claiming one
key are reported, not read.

## Brief format

A brief is YAML frontmatter followed by an optional Markdown body. Where the two
disagree, the frontmatter wins; the body only fills fields the frontmatter left
out.

```markdown
---
id: gp-oauth-auth
title: "Implement OAuth2 and passkey authentication"
status: ready
priority: 1
severity: high
type: feature
labels: [auth, security]
planned_files:
  - src/auth.rs
acceptance_criteria:
  - Support PKCE code exchange flow
---

# Task brief v1

## Description
Add PKCE authorization code flow and passkey credentials support.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Support PKCE code exchange flow
```

The frontmatter is a strict YAML subset: `key: value`, `key: [a, b]`, and
`- item` block lists. Quote a value that begins with a quote or `[`. Unknown
statuses, priorities and severities are errors, not guesses. A body without
frontmatter — what GitPulse's **Copy saved brief** produces, or a hand-written
`# Title` file — is accepted too.

## Reading a task

`gitpulse_get_task` takes the `task_id` you filed it with, or an `item_id` from
`gitpulse_list_tasks`. It returns the stored task and `brief`: the same Markdown
GitPulse hands an agent it launches on that task. Work from that brief.

A task that no longer exists says where it went: `task_merged` names the
`item_id` its work was merged into (read that one instead), and
`task_deleted` gives the reason it was deleted. `not_found` means the board
never had it under this repository.

## Finishing a task

When GitPulse launched you on a task, the brief's first lines name it:
`Task: <id> (revision N)`. When every acceptance criterion is met and your
verification passed, move it to `done`:

```json
{
  "repo_path": "/absolute/path/to/repo",
  "task_id": "<id from the Task: line>",
  "summary": "What changed, and the checks you ran and their results."
}
```

- `status` defaults to `done`. Use `review` instead when a person must judge
  the result before it counts as finished, and `in_progress` when you start.
- Only the status changes. The `summary` (at most 4,000 characters) is appended
  to the task's logs so the person sees what you did; nothing else is rewritten,
  and a person's edit made while you worked is kept.
- Pass `expected_revision` (the `N` from `Task: <id> (revision N)`) to be
  refused with `revision_conflict` if the task changed since you read it; then
  re-read it with `gitpulse_get_task` before deciding.
- The same call twice answers `unchanged`. A task already `done` is never
  reopened (`already_done`): ask the person.
- Do not mark a task done that you did not finish, or whose verification failed.
  Say what is left instead, and use `review`.
- If your task was merged into another while you worked, completing it is
  refused with `task_merged`, naming the target. Report on that one instead.

## Deleting a task

`gitpulse_delete_task` removes a card from the board — the same delete as the
board's own **Delete**. Use it only for a task that should not exist. For a
duplicate, use `gitpulse_merge_tasks` instead, which keeps its content on the
card that stays. Never delete a task to finish it; move it to `done` instead.

```json
{
  "repo_path": "/absolute/path/to/repo",
  "task_id": "gp-oauth-auth",
  "reason": "Merged into gp-auth-overhaul, which carries both sets of criteria."
}
```

- `task_id` is the key it was filed with, or an `item_id` from
  `gitpulse_list_tasks`. `reason` is required (at most 1,000 characters).
- The reason is appended to the task's logs first, so it is in the task's
  history and in the deletion itself. If the task changes between the two, it
  is not deleted and keeps the reason; with `expected_revision` that is refused
  with `revision_conflict`, without it the delete is retried on top of the
  person's edit and the reason is not appended twice.
- The delete is soft: the row and its history stay in the GitPulse profile and
  the id is never reused — filing the same `task_id` again is refused with
  `deleted_on_board`. There is **no undelete** over MCP; only the person can
  restore it.
- A task linked to other repositories too is refused with `shared_task`, since
  deleting it here deletes it there. Ask the person.
- A task an agent may still be working on — an attempt prepared, starting,
  running, or with an unresolved outcome — is refused with `task_in_use`,
  listing the attempts. Pass `even_if_running: true` only when that agent is
  you, or the person asked for this.
- The same call twice answers `unchanged`. A task of another repository is
  `not_found`.

## Merging tasks

`gitpulse_merge_tasks` folds duplicate or overlapping tasks into one task that
stays, then deletes the others. Read every task with `gitpulse_get_task`
first and choose as the target the one that best names the concern; a card
the person made is usually the right one to keep.

```json
{
  "repo_path": "/absolute/path/to/repo",
  "into_task_id": "gp-auth-overhaul",
  "sources": [{ "task_id": "gp-oauth-auth" }, { "task_id": "gp-passkeys", "expected_revision": 4 }],
  "reason": "One concern: both are steps of the auth overhaul."
}
```

- At most 25 sources per call. `reason` is required and is recorded on the
  target and on every source.
- The target keeps its title, status, owner and place on the board. Its
  description gains a `## Merged from <item_id>: <title>` section per source,
  with that task's status, priority and description. It gets the union of
  every source's acceptance criteria and labels, and the most urgent
  priority, highest severity and earliest due date among them; `escalated`
  lists what changed. Source logs are not copied; they stay in each
  source's history (`logs_kept_in_history` lists which had any).
- Each source is then deleted, with the reason and the target named in its
  history, so an agent asking after it gets `task_merged`. It is deleted only
  at the revision that was copied: a source edited mid-merge is copied again
  first, never lost.
- Refused with **nothing written**: a source linked to another repository too
  (`shared_task`), one an agent may still be working on (`task_in_use`,
  unless `even_if_running: true`), a `done` target with an open source
  (`target_done`), a target whose description the person locked
  (`field_locked`), more than one task can hold (`merge_too_large`), a
  source that is the target or is listed twice, and any `expected_revision`
  that no longer matches (`revision_conflict`).
- Each store write is its own transaction, so a merge can be interrupted or
  overtaken by an edit. It then answers `ok: false`, `outcome: "partial"`,
  with each source's `outcome` (`merged`, `already_merged`, `not_merged`)
  and `next_step`. Run the **same call again** to finish: a section already
  in the target is recognised and not copied twice. Every source's work is
  on a live card throughout.
- The same call after it finished answers `unchanged`. There is **no
  unmerge** over MCP; only the person can restore a source.

## Guarantees

- **One board.** These tools read and write the store the task board renders,
  under the same repository record GitPulse registers when the person opens the
  repository. Linked worktrees share one record.
- **Trusted repositories only** for writes. A refused or invalid request
  changes nothing.
- **Idempotent.** Keys are stable per repository, concurrent writers converge on
  one card per key, and deletions on the board are respected.
- **Recorded.** Every write is a revision in the board's own event history.
