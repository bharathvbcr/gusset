# DevCouncil Hero Loop

This is an **opt-in strict task workflow**. It does not override
`gates.mode=off` or make tasks, leases, or verification mandatory for ordinary
work. Run it only when the user explicitly requests the hero/task loop or when
strict enforcement is active.

DevCouncil's certified end-to-end path for Claude Code uses the **verify, lease, and MCP modules**: the agent checks out a task,
implements inside declared scope, verifies deterministically, self-repairs from typed
next actions, and releases — **without a human pasting test output back and forth.**
Manvi wraps the same components for multi-agent campaigns; GitPulse uses Manvi and selected DevCouncil modules rather than the full suite.

## The loop

```
checkout_task ─▶ (agent implements) ─▶ verify_task ─▶ passed? ─▶ release_task
      ▲                                     │
      │                                     ▼ blocking gaps
      └──────────── self-repair ◀──── next_actions (typed)
```

## Step-by-step workflow

### 1. Pick up work

```
devcouncil_next_task          # highest-priority unblocked task (or a known TASK-ID)
devcouncil_checkout_task      # acquire lease — required before verify in enforce
```

Checkout returns the scope with the lease: planned files, allowed commands,
expected tests and gate mode all ride on its result.

One agent owns the task at a time. If checkout fails (lease held), do not bypass — pick
another task or wait for release.

### 2. Implement inside scope

- Read and edit files, and run tests, with your host's own tools. DevCouncil serves
  no file or shell tools, and nothing gates a write as it happens.
- Inspect changes with `devcouncil_get_diff`.
- Preflight questionable paths with `devcouncil_policy_check_write`, the one policy
  tool that survived. It answers the scope question; it does not perform the write.
  Pass your `task_id` and the `operation` (`create`, `modify` or `delete`): without
  `task_id` the answer stops at `task.absent` and says nothing about scope.

Stay inside the task's **planned files** and **allowed commands**. Do not expand scope
silently: no tool widens a task's planned files, so a task that genuinely needs a
wider scope is a question for its owner, not a tool call.

When the advisor tool is available, consult it before committing to an approach, when
stuck on a recurring error, and before declaring the task complete.

### 3. Verify

```
devcouncil_verify_task        # deterministic verifier — lease required in enforce
```

Returns `passed`, `blocking_gaps`, and `next_actions`. A green test suite is not enough;
the verifier checks planned-file compliance, orphan diffs, acceptance evidence, diff
coverage, stub detection, and more.

### 4. Self-repair from next_actions

When `passed` is false, the typed actions are already in the verify result. To
re-read the persisted gaps later without verifying again:

```
devcouncil_get_gaps           # cheap read of persisted gaps — no re-verify
```

Each action is typed (`category`: `fix_code`, `add_test`, `fix_verification`, `scope`,
`security`, `review`, `plan`, `refresh_map`) with `file`, `line`, and often `suggested_command`.
Fix each blocking action, then call `devcouncil_verify_task` again. Repeat until clean.

Inside this opted-in loop, do **not** weaken tests, stub around gaps, or skip
verification to force a pass.

### 5. Release

```
devcouncil_release_task       # only after verify passes (or explicit abandon policy)
```

Report: task ID, what changed, verification result, and any advisory (non-blocking) gaps.

## Alternatives to manual MCP driving

| Entry | When |
|---|---|
| Subagent `devcouncil-implementer` | Delegate the entire loop |
| `dev verify TASK-ID --json` | Scripting or CI: the same verifier, from a shell |

DevCouncil has no command that plans a goal into tasks or drives the loop for you;
Manvi is the harness that runs it end to end.

## Common mistakes

- Skipping checkout during the **hero loop** (verification needs a lease in `enforce`).
  Interactive assist Shell does not require checkout.
- Calling `devcouncil_verify_task` without a lease in `enforce` mode (rejected).
- Declaring done on test pass alone (verifier may report `diff_not_exercised`, stubs, scope gaps).
- Ignoring `next_actions` categories — branch on `category`, not prose parsing.
